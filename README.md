# 6070_CA-04

CA-04

The purpose of this assignment is to find the optimal value of a key ensemble method using RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGB. I was given a dataset obtained from Census Bureau and did my best to understand the data, split it into train and test data, ran the 4 classifiers listed above using n_estimator values = [50,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500], graphed the accuracy and AUC score results in a line graph, then compared the results in a table.

To view this assignment, download the 6070_CA_04.ipynb file and upload it to JupyterLab or GoogleColab. To upload the file, go to the file icon on either JupyterLab or GoogleColab and press the Upload arrow icon. Select the 6070_CA_04.ipynb file that you had previously downloaded and upload it. If on GoogleColab, go to the File tab to the right of the CO orange symbol, go to Open Notebook, go to Upload, and select the 6070_CA_04.ipynb file. If on JupyterLab, double click that file and see it pop up. Click either Run or Runtime and Run All Cells to run all of the code. Scroll from top to bottom to see my Decision Tree process. I have embetted headings, comments, explanations, and observations within the code so that it is more easily understood to the viewer.
